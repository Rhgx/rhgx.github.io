\section*{\textcolor{darkblue}{The mercs just hit the vault and came back loaded with fresh content, and plenty of goodies to go around!}}




\subsection*{\textcolor{darkblue}{SEASONAL BATTLEPASSES}}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{darkgreen}{You ever wish there was more to do outside of pushing carts, standing on control points, and spending your precious time defending? With this update, we’re unveiling a brand new seasonal pass system alongside a new premium currency, Intel!}
    \item \textcolor{darkgreen}{The seasonal battlepasses are a new means to earn items and our newest currency. Each tier holds a reward that requires XP to be claimed. You automatically progress onto the next tier and can claim your items whenever.}
\end{itemize}




\subsection*{\textcolor{darkblue}{NEW CONTRACT SYSTEM}}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{darkgreen}{Contracts have been completely overhauled!}
    \item \textcolor{darkgreen}{Contracts are split into three different sections: Daily, Weekly, and Seasonal}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textcolor{darkgreen}{Daily contracts are contracts you receive every day, and are generally easy objectives that do not take long to complete. These contracts only reward you with funds.}
        \item \textcolor{darkgreen}{Weekly contracts are contracts received every week, and these contracts are a little more difficult than daily contracts. These contracts reward you with XP for your seasonal pass.}
        \item \textcolor{darkgreen}{Seasonal contracts are contracts received every season, and these contracts are the hardest of them all. They give huge boosts of XP for your seasonal pass.}

The Intel store has finally opened and with it, comes a whole list of items you’ve probably been dying to get your hands on! Spend your Intel here but be warned, Intel is \textit{much} harder to obtain than Funds.}
    \item \textcolor{darkgreen}{The archived section of this store contains items you might’ve not gotten, whether it be reskins or cosmetics. Any item purchased from here will be in Unique quality, not be sellable/giftable, and will be marked with a “Purchased from Fitten Co.’s Archived Store” tag.}

We’ve now expanded our gamepasses section to include new UGC that provide in-game rewards! All of our UGC will only be purchasable in-game, and will reward you upon purchase. More UGC will come soon, so keep an eye out for any more UGC we release!}
    \item \textcolor{darkgreen}{The Dorcus Cap UGC will reward you with the Beetle Brooch, the RED, GRN, and Typical Colors caps will reward you with the Team Cap. Every item you are rewarded in-game will be in Genuine quality.}
